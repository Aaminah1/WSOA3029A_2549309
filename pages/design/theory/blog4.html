            </div>

           
               <span class="highlight">Map as the Core Visualization:</span> <p>The map serves as the primary visual representation of
               exoplanets, placing the user in a familiar, explorative interface akin to real-world map tools. Maps are
               a
               universally recognizable form of data visualization that invite exploration. Given the theme/ story of my
               site (focused on space exploration and exoplanets), the map metaphor helps users visualize the vastness
               of
               space, with exoplanets as points of interest. The map creates a narrative of discovery, which aligns with
               the site’s purpose: shifting attention from mundane, Earth-bound concerns to the broader universe.
               Additionally, based on the principle that form follows function, the map format allows users to explore
               space as they would a terrestrial map, making navigation intuitive and functional. This also ties into
               the
               concept of creating an experience that accommodates a diverse audience, ensuring that even users with
               varying technical skills can engage with the data.
            </p>
            
               <span class="highlight">Search Functionality:</span><p> A search bar, along with a drop-down list of all the exoplanets,
               allows users to input specific exoplanet names to quickly locate them on the map. The search function
               provides ease of access for users who have specific knowledge or interests. For example, a space
               enthusiast
               or someone familiar with exoplanets may want to jump directly to a planet they’ve read about. This
               feature
               streamlines their journey and makes the data more approachable by offering direct access rather than
               forcing
               users to manually navigate the map.
            </p>
            
               <span class="highlight">Filter Options:</span><p> Filters allow users to toggle between different categories of exoplanets
               (rocky, icy, potentially habitable). Filters help declutter the map and allow users to control the data
               they
               view. This prevents cognitive overload, aligning with the principle of eliminating clutter and allowing
               users to focus on digestible chunks of information.
            </p>
            
               <span class="highlight">Hover Tooltips:</span><p> When users hover over an exoplanet on the map, a tooltip appears,
               showing
               key details like the exoplanet’s name. Tooltips allow for progressive disclosure of information,
               providing
               just enough detail to satisfy initial curiosity. This aligns with the idea of giving users 3–8 seconds to
               understand the core data without overwhelming them with too much information at once.
            </p>
            
               <span class="highlight">Click to Reveal More Information:</span><p> Clicking on an exoplanet opens a panel with more
               detailed
               information, including discovery data, orbital characteristics, and potential habitability. This feature
               provides users with control over how much detail they explore, balancing exploration and explanation.
               Additionally, a button in this panel directs the user to the second data visualization, where the same
               data
               is presented in a more digestible way.
            </p>
            
               <span class="highlight">Zoom and Pan Features:</span><p> The map allows for zooming in and out, as well as panning across
               regions of space. These features align with the exploration theme and provide an intuitive way to manage
               a
               large dataset. Preattentive attributes like zoom allow users to adjust their perspective, ensuring they
               don't feel overwhelmed by the vast number of exoplanets.
            </p>
            
               <span class="highlight">Cluster Visualization:</span><p> Initially, exoplanets are grouped into clusters to prevent
               clutter,
               especially when viewing a large portion of the map. As users zoom in, clusters break apart to reveal
               individual exoplanets. Clustering supports visual hierarchy, enabling users to start with a broad
               overview
               before diving into detailed exploration.
            </p>
            
               <span class="highlight">Zoom-Based Detail Unfolding:</span><p> As users zoom further into the map, more exoplanets and
               their
               associated data are revealed in greater detail. This progressive unfolding enhances the storytelling
               element, encouraging users to engage deeper with the data over time.

         <!-- Data Visual 2: Bubble Chart -->
         <section id="bubble-chart">
            <h2>Data Visual 2: Bubble Chart</h2>
            <div class="centered-image-container">

                  <figcaption>Bubble chart wireframe showing how different variables such as planet size and
                     habitability are visualized.</figcaption>
               </figure>
            </div>

            
               <span class="highlight">Bubble Chart as the Main Visualization:</span><p> The bubble chart is used to represent
               exoplanets, where the size of the bubbles correlates with attributes like the planet's size or
               habitability potential, while the position on the axes represents other relevant data points (e.g.,
               distance from Earth, temperature, or mass). Bubble charts mimic the shape of planets, aligning with the
               space exploration theme. This form of visualization is ideal for representing multiple variables at once,
               offering a rich, multidimensional view.
            </p>
            
               <span class="highlight">Tooltips on Hover (for Bubbles and Axes):</span><p> Hovering over a bubble reveals a tooltip with
               key information (e.g., exoplanet name, size, distance, and habitability potential). Similarly, tooltips
               on the axes provide context about what each axis represents.
            </p>
           
               <span class="highlight">Filter by Category:</span> <p>Users can filter bubbles by various categories, allowing them to
               focus on specific subsets of exoplanets. This helps reduce cognitive load by narrowing the scope of the
               data presented.
            </p>
            
               <span class="highlight">Highlighting Categories on Hover (Legend Interaction):</span><p> Hovering over a category in the
               legend highlights all bubbles associated with that category on the chart, while dimming the other bubbles
               for visual focus. This feature enhances usability and provides a clean visual focus for comparing data
               across categories.
            </p>
            
               <span class="highlight">Zoom Functionality:</span><p> The zoom feature allows users to zoom in on densely packed or
               overlapping bubbles, making it easier to view and interact with the data. This encourages deeper
               exploration of the data, making sure users can explore the information without overwhelming them.
