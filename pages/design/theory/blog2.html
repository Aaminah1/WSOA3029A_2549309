                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Curious Learners: </strong>
                        <p>This group includes students, hobbyists, and those with a general curiosity about space and
                            science but who may not have an advanced understanding of astronomy. They are looking for
                            accessible, easy-to-digest information that sparks their interest in space exploration.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>General Public: </strong>
                        <p>Casual visitors who may not have a deep knowledge of space but are drawn to visually
                            compelling and interactive content.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Space Enthusiasts: </strong>
                        <p>Individuals who are passionate about space exploration, exoplanet research, and the search
                            for extraterrestrial life. They may already have a solid understanding of space-related
                            topics and are looking for detailed, interactive content to deepen their knowledge.</p>

                <h2>Story/Purpose</h2>
                <p>The purpose of this website is to shift users' focus away from the materialistic, self-centered
                    concerns that overwhelm much of modern life. In a world consumed by social media and shallow,
                    material pursuits, this website aims to redirect attention to the vast possibilities of the universe
                    and life beyond Earth. By providing accessible, interactive information about exoplanets and space
                    exploration, it encourages users to step outside their small, Earth-bound realities and immerse
                    themselves in the wonder of the cosmos.</p>
                <h2>End goal</h2>
                <p>Basically, the end goal is to <strong>Educate and Inspire </strong> through broadening users'
                    perspectives by showing them the vastness of the universe and the possibilities beyond the confines
                    of materialism, self-centeredness, and the distractions of daily life. The site aims to open their
                    minds to the awe-inspiring potential of space exploration and the wonders of life beyond our planet.

                <h2>Content Requirements</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Visualization of Exoplanets (Priority):</strong>
                        <p>This is the central feature of the site, providing an interactive experience where users can
                            explore exoplanet data.
                            The visualization should allow users to uncover details like size, distance from Earth,
                            potential habitability, and other key factors.
                            Interactive elements should encourage exploration, with options to filter and zoom in on
                            specific categories or planets.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Information About Exoplanets:</strong>
                        <p>Provide a section that offers a general introduction to exoplanets, explaining what they are,
                            how they are discovered, and why they are important for understanding space.
                            This section should be clear and accessible, aimed at curious learners and general visitors
                            who might need some context before diving into the data.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Gallery of Space Images:</strong>
                        <p>A visually captivating gallery showcasing high-quality images of space, exoplanets, and
                            related celestial bodies.
                            This gallery would serve to enhance the aesthetic appeal of the site and keep users engaged
                            visually. It can act as a complementary feature to the data visualizations, reinforcing the
                            theme of space exploration.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                </ul>
                <p>Note: Prioritizing Data Visualization first, while the Information and Gallery sections provide
                    supplementary content that enriches the overall experience.</p>

                <h2>Technical and Time Constraints</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Limited Technologies:</strong>
                        <p>The project is restricted to using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the D3.js library for data
                            visualizations. This limits the range of advanced features like making 3D planet models
                            using three.js, or better maps using Leaflet.js which could have made the visuals more
                            outstanding.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Data Source Limitations:</strong>
                        <p> The project relies on live data from APIs, these could lead to unexpected problems in
                            general.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Time for Research:</strong>
                        <p>Integrating live data from APIs involves time spent understanding the API documentation,
                            testing data retrieval, and working out how to implement the data in an interactive way.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Time for Testing and Debugging:</strong>
                        <p> Testing the interactive elements, visualizations, and responsiveness across multiple devices
                            and browsers will require time. Debugging issues that arise from API calls, data
                            visualization, or layout inconsistencies may consume a significant portion of the project
                            timeline.</p>
                    </li>
