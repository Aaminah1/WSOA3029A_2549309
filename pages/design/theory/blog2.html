     <h2>Predesign decision</h2>
      <h3>Target Audience</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Curious Learners: </strong> <p>This group includes students, hobbyists, and those with a general curiosity about space and science but who may not have an advanced understanding of astronomy. They are looking for accessible, easy-to-digest information that sparks their interest in space exploration.</p> </li>
        <li><strong>General Public: </strong> <p>Casual visitors who may not have a deep knowledge of space but are drawn to visually compelling and interactive content.</p> </li>
        <li><strong>Space Enthusiasts: </strong><p>Individuals who are passionate about space exploration, exoplanet research, and the search for extraterrestrial life. They may already have a solid understanding of space-related topics and are looking for detailed, interactive content to deepen their knowledge.</p></li> 
</ul>
      <h3>Story/Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this website is to shift users' focus away from the materialistic, self-centered concerns that overwhelm much of modern life. In a world consumed by social media and shallow, material pursuits, this website aims to redirect attention to the vast possibilities of the universe and life beyond Earth. By providing accessible, interactive information about exoplanets and space exploration, it encourages users to step outside their small, Earth-bound realities and immerse themselves in the wonder of the cosmos.</p>
      <h4>End goal</h4>
      <p>Basically, the end goal is to <strong>Educate and Inspire </strong> through broadening users' perspectives by showing them the vastness of the universe and the possibilities beyond the confines of materialism, self-centeredness, and the distractions of daily life. The site aims to open their minds to the awe-inspiring potential of space exploration and the wonders of life beyond our planet.</p>
      
      <h3>Content Requirements</h3>
     <ul>
<li><strong>Data Visualization of Exoplanets (Priority):</strong><p>This is the central feature of the site, providing an interactive experience where users can explore exoplanet data.
    The visualization should allow users to uncover details like size, distance from Earth, potential habitability, and other key factors.
    Interactive elements should encourage exploration, with options to filter and zoom in on specific categories or planets.
    </p></li>
<li><strong>Information About Exoplanets:</strong><p>Provide a section that offers a general introduction to exoplanets, explaining what they are, how they are discovered, and why they are important for understanding space.
    This section should be clear and accessible, aimed at curious learners and general visitors who might need some context before diving into the data.
    </p></li>
<li><strong>Gallery of Space Images:</strong><p>A visually captivating gallery showcasing high-quality images of space, exoplanets, and related celestial bodies.
    This gallery would serve to enhance the aesthetic appeal of the site and keep users engaged visually. It can act as a complementary feature to the data visualizations, reinforcing the theme of space exploration.
    </p></li>

     </ul>
      <p>Note: Prioritizing Data Visualization first, while the Information and Gallery sections provide supplementary content that enriches the overall experience.</p>
      <h3>Technical and Time Constraints</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Limited Technologies:</strong><p>The project is restricted to using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the D3.js library for data visualizations. This limits the range of advanced features like making 3D planet models using three.js, or better maps using Leaflet.js which could have made the visuals more outstanding.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Data Source Limitations:</strong><p> The project relies on live data from APIs, these could lead to unexpected problems in general.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Time for Research:</strong><p>Integrating live data from APIs involves time spent understanding the API documentation, testing data retrieval, and working out how to implement the data in an interactive way.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Time for Testing and Debugging:</strong><p> Testing the interactive elements, visualizations, and responsiveness across multiple devices and browsers will require time. Debugging issues that arise from API calls, data visualization, or layout inconsistencies may consume a significant portion of the project timeline.</p></li>
