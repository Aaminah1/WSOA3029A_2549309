                <h2>Global economics and artistic implications </h2>
                <h3>Global Economics</h3>
                <span class="highlight">Accessibility, Universality, Innovation:</span>
                <p>In developing my website, I utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitHub, leveraging these technologies
                    for their functionality and as inclusive and innovative nature of the modern web due to its
                    Accessibility and Universality.</p>
                <p>There was a low barrier to entry. The foundational nature of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript meant I could
                    initiate my project with minimal setup and no financial investment in software, crucial for a
                    student with limited resources. This accessibility is a cornerstone of my development journey,
                    enabling me to contribute to the digital economy from anywhere in the world. The vast resources
                    available for these technologies allowed me to self-teach aspects of advanced web design and
                    interactive data visualization, skills that I've showcased in the interactive maps and
                    visualizations on my site. This aspect of continuous learning and application is reflective of the
                    global movement towards lifelong learning and digital literacy. In my project, leveraging D3.js—an
                    advanced, open-source JavaScript library for data visualization—illustrated how accessible
                    technologies can lead to sophisticated solutions. D3.js itself is a product of a community-driven
                    approach to solving data representation challenges on the web, continually updated and maintained by
                    contributions from developers worldwide. My ability to implement such complex visualizations
                    seamlessly is a testament to the ecosystem's power fueled by accessibility and universality.</p>
                <p>Utilizing GitHub for hosting and version control exemplified the economic advantages of cloud-based
                    technologies, which reduce the overhead costs typically associated with web development and content
                    management. By hosting my project on GitHub, I tapped into a global network of developers and
                    resources, which accelerated my development process and introduced me to collaborative opportunities
                    I could not have accessed locally. This platform not only supported my technical needs but also
                    connected me with a community that shares and critiques code, enhancing the project's quality and
                    reach. Although I used github for its free server, GitHub hosts millions of open-source projects,
                    facilitating collaboration across borders. It acts as a social platform for developers, providing
                    opportunities for networking, collaboration, and job placement worldwide. This community aspect can
                    lead to new business opportunities and collaborations that may not have been possible in a more
                    geographically constrained environment. The skills I honed while working on this project are
                    directly applicable to the needs of the global tech economy, where web development remains a
                    critical and sought-after skillset. By aligning my project with these in-demand skills, I've
                    positioned myself within a growing industry that values versatility and innovation.</p>
                <p>As technology continues to grow and become more accessible- proficiency in these languages is crucial
                    and often a basic requirement in many tech jobs, driving employment globally. The demand for web
                    developers continues to grow, contributing significantly to the global tech economy. This widespread
                    accessibility and the universal use of these technologies leads to a vast amount of feedback and
                    real-world testing across different environments and use cases. This continuous loop of feedback and
                    iteration encourages the improvement of existing libraries and the creation of new ones. It ensures
                    that libraries evolve to meet changing developer needs and new web standards, which in turn supports
                    the forward momentum of web technology innovation. Continuous advancements and updates in HTML5,
                    CSS3, and modern JavaScript frameworks push the boundaries of what can be built on the web, leading
                    to innovative applications and services. This drives further economic activity as businesses invest
                    in updating and enhancing their web presence to utilize new capabilities. </p>

                <h3>Artistic Implications</h3>
                <span class="highlight">HTML's Role in Artistic Design:</span>
                <p>Since we were required to use CSS, JavaScript and html to the overall styling and layout of the
                    website, I had to work with its possibilities and limitations when thinking about my design.
                    HTML is the backbone of any web design, defining the structure of web pages and setting the stage
                    upon which CSS and JavaScript act. This foundational structure was crucial for implementing any
                    artistic vision, as it dictates the flow and hierarchy of content, which is key to effective visual
                    storytelling. It is also important for the artistic elements of my design at be understood and
                    indexed correctly for accessible user experience. Html (while the others too) make it possible to
                    embed multimedia resources such as video, audio, and graphics, which can significantly enrich the
                    user interface through the visual narrative it establishes. I mostly used placed images in my html
                    scripts. Along with the icons used for my data visualizations and navigation.
                    The form was another important thing in html that allows users to enter data and interact directly
                    with the site. HTML offers a flexible yet constrained environment to work within. Its limitations in
                    terms of styling and dynamic behavior require a deep integration with CSS and JavaScript to fully
                    realize artistic visions. Styling these forms with CSS and enhancing them with JavaScript turned a
                    simple interaction into a visually appealing and artistically integrated experience. This was
                    important for maintaining the aesthetic consistency of the site while providing functional user
                    interfaces.
                    I mention more about this under the professional practices section too, but HTML was also necessary
                    for SEO and accessibility.
                </p>
                <span class="highlight">CSS's Influence on Aesthetics:</span>
                <p>
                    CSS takes the basic structures provided by HTML and enhances them, applying styles that transform
                    plain content into engaging, professionally designed elements.
                    I made use of CSS for basic animations and transitions for buttons, headings and most of the
                    interactive elements. But I wanted to be creative and have better control and variety to some of my
                    dynamic elements, like the stary background on the home page and the sparkling line borders in the
                    theory pages. Since we were not allowed to use Libraries such as jQuery or Bootstrap, I used a
                    combination of CSS and js to make this possible. So, I was able to overcome that limitation to
                    creativity and achieve my goal of making a stary dynamic background.
                    I used CSS flexbox and media queries to help with the responsive design and combined a little bit of
                    js for the responsive navigation which changes to a hamburger menu for smaller screens

                </p>
                <p>
                    CSS allows me to have control over so much, from paragraphs, spacing, fonts, colours, responsive
                    design layouts, all of which I can manipulate to create the mood of my website. The fact that it
                    works in a separate script yet can apply changes across the entire site makes it so effective to
                    change and experiment for the desired outcome and create branding and identify through this
                    consistency possible through a single script. It also prevents script from getting to long with
                    repetitive code which could affect load time.
                </p>
                <span class="highlight">JavaScript's Dynamic Enhancements:</span>
                <p>JavaScript was essential for adding interactivity to web pages. It enables users to interact with
                    elements on the page while dynamically changing CSS properties based on user interactions, enhancing
                    effects like hover or click without refreshing the page and add, remove, or change HTML elements on
                    the page in response to user actions. This manipulation allows for creative and dynamic compositions
                    that adapt to the user's behavior, providing an interactive narrative that can captivate and engage,
                    making the design feel more alive and reactive.
                    JavaScript made it possible for me to create data visualizations. JavaScript's capability to fetch
                    data from APIs enabled the inclusion of external live data. Coupled with some of the libraries such
                    as D3 for manipulation and displaying of that data.
                    Using the three languages together allowed me to dynamically generate certain elements on each page
                    like navigations, footers, next and previous buttons, breadcrumb… which saved time from hardcoding,
                    reducing repetitive html code , made editing then easier and remain consistent in style.
                </p>

                <span class="highlight">VS Code's Enhanced Design Experimentation:</span>
                <p>VS Code’s extensions such as Live Server made it possible to immediately see how my code changes
                    affect the visual presentation of my website. This instant feedback loop encourages more
                    experimental approaches to design, as I could quickly iterate and see the outcomes, helping to test
                    and fine-tuning more.
                    It also has built-in support for Git. This made it easier to manage changes and experiment with
                    different design elements and revert to previous versions if needed, providing a safety net that
                    encourages creativity and experimentation.
                </p>


                <h2>How UI/UX designs create meaning</h2>
                <h3>Overall website </h3>
                <p>In developing the website's UI/UX, I focused on creating an engaging atmosphere that aligns with the
                    website’s space exploration theme through consistent use of colors, dynamic animations, navigational
                    elements (nav, footer, breadcrumbs, side nav, back to top button, next and previous buttons) and
                    strategic placement of text and images. By reducing text and prioritizing visual storytelling, I
                    made it easier for users to grasp the context at a glance, reducing the cognitive load and enhancing
                    accessibility. This applied for the timeline. This approach is supported by clear headings and
                    subheadings, which help users navigate the site more efficiently and familiarize themselves with its
                    structure quickly. I also added buttons that would take the user to more information if they were
                    more interested in the particular topic that I briefly touch on as to keep the focus on the visuals
                    and “viewing the space atmosphere”. The placement of text and images was strategically used to guide
                    the users eye flow through the page and distract them from being engaging and overwhelmed with to
                    much text, as seem on the home and about page, where the images appear along side the text and
                    switch for every section to give the user a quick break from the text and remind them of space and
                    planets , to create more wonder and thoughts.</p>
                <p>By minimizing text and using icons and symbols, taking advantages of iconic memory,I have crafted a
                    user experience that encourages
                    visual exploration and interaction, which is far more engaging than static text-based content. This
                    decision promotes an intuitive journey through the site, where discovery is driven by the user’s
                    curiosity and visual cues, aligning with the goal of making the site a visually-driven exploration
                    of space.
                    Subtle borders and lines act as visual cues that organize information and divide content into
                    digestible sections. These elements, alongside other dynamic animations, ensure the interface
                    remains lively and engaging without overwhelming the user. Animations like the stars on the homepage
                    and how content appears and behaves with subtle movement serve to bring the site to life,
                    reinforcing the theme of liveliness and constant activity which is crucial for keeping the user
                    interested.
                </p>
                <p>The glow effects on headings and hover states, designed to mimic the glowing of stars, enhance the
                    thematic consistency of exploring space, making the user experience feel more immersive. The choice
                    of a color palette with blues, greys, and blacks creates an atmosphere reminiscent of space, while
                    selective use of yellow highlights interactive elements, guiding users to understand that these
                    components are interactive and impactful, such as buttons that alter the state of the site or
                    activate features.</p>
                <p>The design of interactive elements based on conventional usability principles allows users to
                    navigate the interface effortlessly without needing detailed instructions (like the standard
                    placement of the navigation, control buttons for next, previous, top, pause, resume, zoom, refresh
                    …). This ease of interaction, not needing instructions, is critical for engaging users effectively,
                    allowing them to explore content deeper without frustration. I considered adding tooltips for
                    clarity, but to avoid the annoyance that persistent tooltips can cause, I limited their use to
                    essential interactions only. To further aid navigation, I incorporated clear feedback mechanisms for
                    different interaction states and provided additional navigational tools like sticky side navigation,
                    breadcrumbs, and 'back to top' buttons, which enhance user flow and reduce the effort required to
                    navigate through dense information.</p>

                <h3> Data visualizations</h3>
                <p>The <span class="highlight">solar system data visualization:</span> was quite flawed and I feel most
                    frustrating for the user. The current layout requires scrolling to access essential controls, such
                    as zoom, which are not visible on the screen simultaneously with other elements of the
                    visualization. Furthermore, scrolling can unintentionally trigger the zoom feature, leading to user
                    frustration. This issue can disorient users, making it difficult for them to interact with the
                    visualization effectively and diminishing its educational and exploratory value as they may no
                    longer want to interact with it.
                    Information panels that display details about planets or orbits overlap with the solar system
                    visualization. This issue is exacerbated when the solar system is zoomed in, as it covers a large
                    area of the display, creating a cluttered and overwhelming visual space. The overlapping panels can
                    hinder users’ ability to smoothly absorb information and detract from the overall enjoyment and of
                    the visualization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reflecting on the<span class="highlight"> interactive exoplanet map</span>, it seems that while the
                    intention was to create a user-friendly and exploratory experience, there are aspects that could be
                    improved to better meet these goals. The transition from a few clusters to thousands of exoplanets
                    can be overwhelming for users, especially since the exoplanets are represented by similar shapes
                    that scatter across the map, making it difficult to select a specific one for further exploration.
                    This can lead to a feeling of randomness rather than meaningful exploration, as users may struggle
                    to discern why one exoplanet might be more relevant or interesting than another based on the visual
                    information provided. Although the filter was designed to help users control what they see by
                    categorizing exoplanets into different shapes, there lacks sufficient visual differentiation to make
                    each category stand out. While tooltips are used to provide additional information, this might not
                    be enough for users new to astronomy, who could find the text overwhelming or indistinguishable.
                    Without clearer visual cues or images to instantly differentiate the planets, the experience can
                    feel confusing and less engaging, particularly for users who are not familiar with exoplanet
                    attributes.
                    The exploration element does not feel impactful or significant, especially for users unfamiliar with
                    exoplanets and their specific attributes. The absence of visual diversity and detail at closer zoom
                    levels means the learning potential and user engagement might be limited. Introducing another layer
                    of detail upon further zooming could address this. For instance, after categorizing exoplanets, a
                    further zoom could reveal unique images or distinctive visual markers for each exoplanet. While the
                    initial plan to show unique images
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <span class="highlight">chart map</span>, designed to visualize exoplanets, was functionally
                    straightforward and conveyed the intended message through its visual elements. The use of bubble
                    sizes effectively represented the varying radii of exoplanets, and the color spectrum, ranging from
                    greens to purples, was intended to indicate temperature variations. However, the color transitions
                    might not immediately convey temperature differences (as conventionally it would have been blues
                    transitioning to reds) to all users due to the subtlety of the color scheme, which I attempted to
                    clarify with a colour legend, therefore its impact is lessened. Currently, the mass of each planet
                    is only visible through tooltips, which might not be sufficient for users who are specifically
                    interested in this attribute. I should consider whether to keep this feature as a central aspect of
                    the visualization or remove it from the primary focus (the subtitle and description) if it cannot be
                    effectively visualized. The chart includes tooltips for axes and other elements to aid
                    comprehension, which is beneficial for users unfamiliar with astronomy. Even the colours of all the
                    bubbles are similar and not none is really standing out to draw attention to a certain bubbles,
                    which again is not a good idea as the short term memory can typically only handle four different
                    types at a time. This doesn't help to seperate important and less important information. However,
                    adding targeted
                    text or annotations within the chart could guide users to specific observations or insights, adding
                    a layer of directed learning to the exploratory experience. To increase the chart’s educational
                    value, incorporating focused text or highlighted areas that draw user attention to aspects or
                    anomalies within the data could help frame user exploration and provide context. This would offer
                    not just a freestyle exploration but also a guided discovery process, enhancing the user's learning
                    experience.

                <p>
                    I feel like although my intent was to make all these data visualization all for self-exploration and
                    learning, it can be confusing for users new to astronomy to make any meaningful interpretations.
                    Clearly I have focused much on the aesthics and function (interactive elements specifically) but
                    wihtout a main purpose. It
                    is too free styled. We could have kept this but also subtly guide a direction or show our own
                    intended story/ information and main point to take from each of them for some users to be able to
                    conceptualize it and then be able to make better use and understanding of that information and have
                    a more planned or purposeful approach to exploring the data. Like a balance with Exploration and
                    Explanation. Reflecting on the readings and my design for the data visualization I realized that I
                    did not work on focusing my user’s attentions more specifically, rather I focused on the broader
                    overall theme of exploration. At some points I feel like I took the “clutter is your enemy” to
                    serious and that’s why lacked focusing audience
                </p>
                <h2>The role of interactivity</h2>
                <span class="highlight">User-Centric Exploration:</span>
                <p>
                    The interactive design is meticulously crafted to enable users to feel they are personally
                    navigating through the cosmos. The website starts with a broad, visually rich overview of the
                    universe, setting a contemplative stage that invites users to appreciate the scale before diving
                    deeper into specific astronomical phenomena. This approach aligns perfectly with the website’s
                    purpose to redirect attention from the mundane to the majestic. View more detail in <a
                        href="blog2.html">Predesign decision</a></p>
                <span class="highlight">Gradual Discovery and Purposeful Design:</span>
                <p>As users interact with the website, they uncover layers of information about the universe, mimicking
                    the act of exploration and discovery. This method of unveiling information piece by piece helps to
                    manage cognitive load, ensuring users are not overwhelmed but are instead intrigued to learn more.
                    Each interactive element, from zooming in on different exoplanets to filtering through data to find
                    specific conditions of habitability, is designed to facilitate a personalized exploration, making
                    the vastness of space more relatable and understandable.</p>
                <span class="highlight">Control and Customization in Learning: </span>
                <p>The interactive tools such as zoom, pan, filters, and pause/resume buttons empower users to control
                    their exploration, adjusting the pace and focus of their learning experience. By allowing users to
                    interact with the data, the project not only makes the learning experience more engaging but also
                    more effective. Users are likely to leave the website with a heightened understanding of space that
                    might influence their perspective on life and material concerns. The goal of the website is to
                    educate users about the universe and inspire them by showcasing the vast possibilities of space
                    exploration. The interactive elements of the website play a pivotal role in achieving this by making
                    users active participants in their learning journey. This participatory approach is intended to
                    inspire a sense of wonder and curiosity, broadening users' perspectives and potentially altering
                    their understanding of their place in the universe.</p>
                <span class="highlight">Broadening Perspectives:</span>
                <p>By engaging users with interactive and immersive content, the website aims to expand their worldview,
                    encouraging them to consider existential questions and the broader implications of human activity in
                    the cosmos. The site strives not just to inform but also to inspire a reevaluation of priorities,
                    focusing on the awe-inspiring potential of space rather than the ephemeral concerns of daily life.
                </p>
                <h2>Challenges </h2>
                <span class="highlight">UI Alignment and Flexbox Usage:</span>
                <p>One of the most significant challenges encountered during the development was aligning interactive UI
                    elements in a way that was intuitive from a design perspective, while also implementing it
                    effectively through code. Specifically, the use of CSS Flexbox for positioning containers that
                    included data visualizations alongside interactive controls proved particularly troublesome. This
                    complexity was compounded by the responsiveness required, leading to occasional overlapping of
                    elements that did not align with the intended design.</p>
                <span class="highlight">Integration of Live API Data:</span>
                <p>Another pressing issue was the integration of live API data, particularly for the exoplanet
                    interactive map. The initial implementation faced a synchronization problem where the search bar and
                    the map markers could not display simultaneously. If the search bar was populated with planet names,
                    the corresponding markers on the map would disappear, and vice versa. This significantly impacted
                    the usability and functionality of the interactive map, a key feature of the website.
                    To resolve this, I tried a global variable to manage the state of the displayed data across
                    different UI components. By centralizing the data state, both the search bar and the map could react
                    to changes in data without interfering with each other’s display. I also separated the concerns by
                    using different scripts: one dedicated to handling the live data fetched from the API and another to
                    manage the UI interactions. This still did not work though.


                <h2>Alignment with professional practices</h2>
                <span class="highlight">Security and data protection:</span>
                <p>Once thing I didn’t have considering that users need to enter their email, phone number into the form
                    I am aware that in profession practiced it would be beneficial to implement security practices to
                    protect users’ data and make the site more trustworthy and reliable. But I mean since we are using
                    GitHub to host our sites, there are https to show that is it secured to some extent. </p>
                <span class="highlight">Code Maintainability and Scalability:</span>
                <p>I practiced writing clean, commenting, consistency of formats and modular code to allow maintenance
                    and future updates. This practice also involves using version control systems like Git to manage
                    changes and potentially collaborate efficiently across distributed teams.</p>
                <span class="highlight">Performance Optimization:</span>
                <p>Effective load and speed of the website is important to prevent bounce rates, especially for
                    commercial websites that rely on costumers.
                    I tried to improve the speed and efficiency by using defer at places to help with the loading time
                    in dedicated scripts for different pages. I also implemented lazy load that loads data as it comes
                    into view rather than all at once, specifically for the home page that has many images. I also used
                    simple shapes for the data visualizations to optimize D3 renderings.
                </p>
                <p>I realized that the use of many images and the fact that they were not optimized (compressed and
                    resized) made the images load take time to load upon first opening the site or when refreshing it,
                    which affect the users experience and user engagement to a certain extent.
                    Although I reduced text and primarily used images to enhance the narrative, headings and subheadings
                    were still employed to reinforce the images' purpose. I incorporated alt text to provide users with
                    basic information while the images loaded, preventing blank spaces on the site. However, this
                    approach particularly affected mobile users, who typically have devices with less processing power
                    than desktops. Large, unoptimized images can deplete device resources, resulting in sluggish
                    performance and a suboptimal user experience. Additionally, the increased data consumption due to
                    large image files is not ideal, as it can lead to higher bandwidth usage.
                </p>
                <span class="highlight">Responsive Design:</span>
                <p>Firstly, responsive design practices align with international web development standards, such as
                    those set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). These standards advocate for web accessibility and
                    usability across different platforms and devices, ensuring a wider reach and inclusivity. I ensured
                    that my site is usable on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones through
                    flexbox and media queries in CSS to create a seamless experience across different screen sizes and
                    orientations. This directly contributes to a positive UX, it prevents usability issues such as
                    unreadable text, unclickable links, or distorted layouts, which can frustrate users and drive them
                    away. Since search engines like Google have adapted their algorithms to prioritize mobile-friendly
                    websites in their rankings. Responsive design is integral to SEO strategies as it helps in reducing
                    bounce rates and increasing time on site by providing a better user experience. Moreover,
                    maintaining a single responsive site rather than separate desktop and mobile versions simplifies URL
                    structure and eliminates duplicate content, both of which are beneficial for SEO.</p>
                <p>Considering that is a commercial website, from a business perspective, responsive design aligns with
                    professional practices by being cost-effective. Maintaining one website that adapts to all devices,
                    rather than separate sites for desktop and mobile, reduces development and maintenance costs. It
                    simplifies the web development process and decreases the likelihood of inconsistencies between
                    different versions of a site. As new devices with different screen sizes and resolutions come to
                    market, a responsive website can adapt to these without needing a complete redesign. This
                    future-proofing aspect makes responsive design a sustainable choice for long-term development.</p>
