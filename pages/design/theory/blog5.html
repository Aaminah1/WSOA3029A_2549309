                <h3>Global Economics</h3>
                <span class="highlight">Accessibility, Universality, Innovation:</span>
                <p>In developing my website, I utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitHub, leveraging these technologies for their functionality and as inclusive and innovative nature of the modern web due to its Accessibility and Universality.</p>
                <p>There was a low barrier to entry. The foundational nature of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript meant I could initiate my project with minimal setup and no financial investment in software, crucial for a student with limited resources. This accessibility is a cornerstone of my development journey, enabling me to contribute to the digital economy from anywhere in the world. The vast resources available for these technologies allowed me to self-teach aspects of advanced web design and interactive data visualization, skills that I've showcased in the interactive maps and visualizations on my site. This aspect of continuous learning and application is reflective of the global movement towards lifelong learning and digital literacy.  In my project, leveraging D3.js—an advanced, open-source JavaScript library for data visualization—illustrated how accessible technologies can lead to sophisticated solutions. D3.js itself is a product of a community-driven approach to solving data representation challenges on the web, continually updated and maintained by contributions from developers worldwide. My ability to implement such complex visualizations seamlessly is a testament to the ecosystem's power fueled by accessibility and universality.</p>
                <p>Utilizing GitHub for hosting and version control exemplified the economic advantages of cloud-based technologies, which reduce the overhead costs typically associated with web development and content management. By hosting my project on GitHub, I tapped into a global network of developers and resources, which accelerated my development process and introduced me to collaborative opportunities I could not have accessed locally. This platform not only supported my technical needs but also connected me with a community that shares and critiques code, enhancing the project's quality and reach. Although I used github for its free server, GitHub hosts millions of open-source projects, facilitating collaboration across borders. It acts as a social platform for developers, providing opportunities for networking, collaboration, and job placement worldwide. This community aspect can lead to new business opportunities and collaborations that may not have been possible in a more geographically constrained environment. The skills I honed while working on this project are directly applicable to the needs of the global tech economy, where web development remains a critical and sought-after skillset. By aligning my project with these in-demand skills, I've positioned myself within a growing industry that values versatility and innovation.</p>

                <h3>Artistic Implications</h3>
                <span class="highlight">HTML's Role in Artistic Design:</span>
                <p>Since we were required to use CSS, JavaScript and html to the overall styling and layout of the website, I had to work with its possibilities and limitations when thinking about my design.
                    HTML is the backbone of any web design, defining the structure of web pages and setting the stage upon which CSS and JavaScript act. This foundational structure was crucial for implementing any artistic vision, as it dictates the flow and hierarchy of content, which is key to effective visual storytelling. It is also important for the artistic elements of my design at be understood and indexed correctly for accessible user experience. Html (while the others too) make it possible to embed multimedia resources such as video, audio, and graphics, which can significantly enrich the user interface through the visual narrative it establishes. I mostly used placed images in my html scripts. Along with the icons used for my data visualizations and navigation.
                    The form was another important thing in html that allows users to enter data and interact directly with the site. HTML offers a flexible yet constrained environment to work within. Its limitations in terms of styling and dynamic behavior require a deep integration with CSS and JavaScript to fully realize artistic visions. Styling these forms with CSS and enhancing them with JavaScript turned a simple interaction into a visually appealing and artistically integrated experience. This was important for maintaining the aesthetic consistency of the site while providing functional user interfaces.
                    I mention more about this under the professional practices section too, but HTML was also necessary for SEO and accessibility. 
                     </p>
                     <span class="highlight">CSS's Influence on Aesthetics:</span>
                     <p>
                        CSS takes the basic structures provided by HTML and enhances them, applying styles that transform plain content into engaging, professionally designed elements.
                        I made use of CSS for basic animations and transitions for buttons, headings and most of the interactive elements. But I wanted to be creative and have better control and variety to some of my dynamic elements, like the stary background on the home page and the sparkling line borders in the theory pages. Since we were not allowed to use Libraries such as jQuery or Bootstrap, I used a combination of CSS and js to make this possible. So, I was able to overcome that limitation to creativity and achieve my goal of making a stary dynamic background.
                       I used CSS flexbox and media queries to help with the responsive design and combined a little bit of js for the responsive navigation which changes to a hamburger menu for smaller screens
                       
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        CSS allows me to have control over so much, from paragraphs, spacing, fonts, colours, responsive design layouts, all of which I can manipulate to create the mood of my website. The fact that it works in a separate script yet can apply changes across the entire site makes it so effective to change and experiment for the desired outcome and create branding and identify through this consistency possible through a single script. It also prevents script from getting to long with repetitive code which could affect load time.
                     </p>
                     <span class="highlight">JavaScript's Dynamic Enhancements:</span>
                     <p>JavaScript was essential for adding interactivity to web pages. It enables users to interact with elements on the page while dynamically changing CSS properties based on user interactions, enhancing effects like hover or click without refreshing the page and add, remove, or change HTML elements on the page in response to user actions. This manipulation allows for creative and dynamic compositions that adapt to the user's behavior, providing an interactive narrative that can captivate and engage, making the design feel more alive and reactive.
                        JavaScript made it possible for me to create data visualizations. JavaScript's capability to fetch data from APIs enabled the inclusion of external live data. Coupled with some of the libraries such as D3 for manipulation and displaying of that data.
                        Using the three languages together allowed me to dynamically generate certain elements on each page like navigations, footers, next and previous buttons, breadcrumb… which saved time from hardcoding, reducing  repetitive html code , made editing then easier and remain consistent in style.
                        </p>
                    
                     <span class="highlight">VS Code's Enhanced Design Experimentation:</span>
                     <p>VS Code’s extensions such as Live Server made it possible to immediately see how my code changes affect the visual presentation of my website. This instant feedback loop encourages more experimental approaches to design, as I could quickly iterate and see the outcomes, helping to test and fine-tuning more.
                        It also has built-in support for Git. This made it easier to manage changes and experiment with different design elements and revert to previous versions if needed, providing a safety net that encourages creativity and experimentation.
                        </p>
                

                <h2>How UI/UX designs create meaning</h2>
                <span class="highlight"></span>
                <p></p>

                <h2>The role of interactivity</h2>
                <span class="highlight">User-Centric Exploration:</span>
                <p>
                    The interactive design is meticulously crafted to enable users to feel they are personally
                    navigating through the cosmos. The website starts with a broad, visually rich overview of the
                    universe, setting a contemplative stage that invites users to appreciate the scale before diving
                    deeper into specific astronomical phenomena. This approach aligns perfectly with the website’s
                    purpose to redirect attention from the mundane to the majestic. View more detail in <a
                        href="blog2.html">Predesign decision</a></p>
                <span class="highlight">Gradual Discovery and Purposeful Design:</span>
                <p>As users interact with the website, they uncover layers of information about the universe, mimicking
                    the act of exploration and discovery. This method of unveiling information piece by piece helps to
                    manage cognitive load, ensuring users are not overwhelmed but are instead intrigued to learn more.
                    Each interactive element, from zooming in on different exoplanets to filtering through data to find
                    specific conditions of habitability, is designed to facilitate a personalized exploration, making
                    the vastness of space more relatable and understandable.</p>
                <span class="highlight">Control and Customization in Learning: </span>
                <p>The interactive tools such as zoom, pan, filters, and pause/resume buttons empower users to control
                    their exploration, adjusting the pace and focus of their learning experience. By allowing users to
                    interact with the data, the project not only makes the learning experience more engaging but also
                    more effective. Users are likely to leave the website with a heightened understanding of space that
                    might influence their perspective on life and material concerns. The goal of the website is to
                    educate users about the universe and inspire them by showcasing the vast possibilities of space
                    exploration. The interactive elements of the website play a pivotal role in achieving this by making
                    users active participants in their learning journey. This participatory approach is intended to
                    inspire a sense of wonder and curiosity, broadening users' perspectives and potentially altering
                    their understanding of their place in the universe.</p>
                <span class="highlight">Broadening Perspectives:</span>
                <p>By engaging users with interactive and immersive content, the website aims to expand their worldview,
                    encouraging them to consider existential questions and the broader implications of human activity in
                    the cosmos. The site strives not just to inform but also to inspire a reevaluation of priorities,
                    focusing on the awe-inspiring potential of space rather than the ephemeral concerns of daily life.
                </p>
                <h2>Challenges </h2>
                <span class="highlight">UI Alignment and Flexbox Usage:</span>
                <p>One of the most significant challenges encountered during the development was aligning interactive UI
                    elements in a way that was intuitive from a design perspective, while also implementing it
                    effectively through code. Specifically, the use of CSS Flexbox for positioning containers that
                    included data visualizations alongside interactive controls proved particularly troublesome. This
                    complexity was compounded by the responsiveness required, leading to occasional overlapping of
                    elements that did not align with the intended design.</p>
                <span class="highlight">Integration of Live API Data:</span>
                <p>Another pressing issue was the integration of live API data, particularly for the exoplanet
                    interactive map. The initial implementation faced a synchronization problem where the search bar and
                    the map markers could not display simultaneously. If the search bar was populated with planet names,
                    the corresponding markers on the map would disappear, and vice versa. This significantly impacted
                    the usability and functionality of the interactive map, a key feature of the website.
                    To resolve this, I tried a global variable to manage the state of the displayed data across
                    different UI components. By centralizing the data state, both the search bar and the map could react
                    to changes in data without interfering with each other’s display. I also separated the concerns by
                    using different scripts: one dedicated to handling the live data fetched from the API and another to
                    manage the UI interactions. This still did not work though.


                <h2>Alignment with professional practices</h2>
                <span class="highlight">Security and data protection:</span>
                <p>Once thing I didn’t have considering that users need to enter their email, phone number into the form
                    I am aware that in profession practiced it would be beneficial to implement security practices to
                    protect users’ data and make the site more trustworthy and reliable. But I mean since we are using
                    GitHub to host our sites, there are https to show that is it secured to some extent. </p>
                <span class="highlight">Code Maintainability and Scalability:</span>
                <p>I practiced writing clean, commenting, consistency of formats and modular code to allow maintenance
                    and future updates. This practice also involves using version control systems like Git to manage
                    changes and potentially collaborate efficiently across distributed teams.</p>
                <span class="highlight">Performance Optimization:</span>
                <p>Effective load and speed of the website is important to prevent bounce rates, especially for
                    commercial websites that rely on costumers.
                    I tried to improve the speed and efficiency by using defer at places to help with the loading time
                    in dedicated scripts for different pages. I also implemented lazy load that loads data as it comes
                    into view rather than all at once, specifically for the home page that has many images. I also used
                    simple shapes for the data visualizations to optimize D3 renderings.
                </p>
                <span class="highlight">Responsive Design:</span>
                <p>Firstly, responsive design practices align with international web development standards, such as
                    those set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). These standards advocate for web accessibility and
                    usability across different platforms and devices, ensuring a wider reach and inclusivity. I ensured
                    that my site is usable on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones through
                    flexbox and media queries in CSS to create a seamless experience across different screen sizes and
                    orientations. This directly contributes to a positive UX, it prevents usability issues such as
                    unreadable text, unclickable links, or distorted layouts, which can frustrate users and drive them
                    away. Since search engines like Google have adapted their algorithms to prioritize mobile-friendly
                    websites in their rankings. Responsive design is integral to SEO strategies as it helps in reducing
                    bounce rates and increasing time on site by providing a better user experience. Moreover,
                    maintaining a single responsive site rather than separate desktop and mobile versions simplifies URL
                    structure and eliminates duplicate content, both of which are beneficial for SEO.</p>
                <p>Considering that is a commercial website, from a business perspective, responsive design aligns with
                    professional practices by being cost-effective. Maintaining one website that adapts to all devices,
                    rather than separate sites for desktop and mobile, reduces development and maintenance costs. It
                    simplifies the web development process and decreases the likelihood of inconsistencies between
                    different versions of a site. As new devices with different screen sizes and resolutions come to
                    market, a responsive website can adapt to these without needing a complete redesign. This
                    future-proofing aspect makes responsive design a sustainable choice for long-term development.</p>
