                <h2>Global economics and artistic implications </h2>
                <h2>How UI/UX designs create meaning</h2>
                <h2>The role of interactivity</h2>
                <h2>Challenges </h2>
                <span class="highlight">UI Alignment and Flexbox Usage:</span>
                <p>One of the most significant challenges encountered during the development was aligning interactive UI
                    elements in a way that was intuitive from a design perspective, while also implementing it
                    effectively through code. Specifically, the use of CSS Flexbox for positioning containers that
                    included data visualizations alongside interactive controls proved particularly troublesome. This
                    complexity was compounded by the responsiveness required, leading to occasional overlapping of
                    elements that did not align with the intended design.</p>
                    <span class="highlight">Integration of Live API Data:</span>
                <p>Another pressing issue was the integration of live API data, particularly for the exoplanet
                    interactive map. The initial implementation faced a synchronization problem where the search bar and
                    the map markers could not display simultaneously. If the search bar was populated with planet names,
                    the corresponding markers on the map would disappear, and vice versa. This significantly impacted
                    the usability and functionality of the interactive map, a key feature of the website.
                    To resolve this, I tried a global variable to manage the state of the displayed data across
                    different UI components. By centralizing the data state, both the search bar and the map could react
                    to changes in data without interfering with each other’s display. I also separated the concerns by
                    using different scripts: one dedicated to handling the live data fetched from the API and another to
                    manage the UI interactions. This still did not work though.


                <h2>Alignment with professional practices</h2>
                <span class="highlight">Security and data protection:</span>
                <p>Once thing I didn’t have considering that users need to enter their email, phone number into the form
                    I am aware that in profession practiced it would be beneficial to implement security practices to
                    protect users’ data and make the site more trustworthy and reliable. But I mean since we are using
                    GitHub to host our sites, there are https to show that is it secured to some extent. </p>
                <span class="highlight">Code Maintainability and Scalability:</span>
                <p>I practiced writing clean, commenting, consistency of formats and modular code to allow maintenance
                    and future updates. This practice also involves using version control systems like Git to manage
                    changes and potentially collaborate efficiently across distributed teams.</p>
                <span class="highlight">Performance Optimization:</span>
                <p>Effective load and speed of the website is important to prevent bounce rates, especially for
                    commercial websites that rely on costumers.
                    I tried to improve the speed and efficiency by using defer at places to help with the loading time
                    in dedicated scripts for different pages. I also implemented lazy load that loads data as it comes
                    into view rather than all at once, specifically for the home page that has many images. I also used
                    simple shapes for the data visualizations to optimize D3 renderings.
                </p>
                <span class="highlight">Responsive Design:</span>
                <p>Firstly, responsive design practices align with international web development standards, such as
                    those set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). These standards advocate for web accessibility and
                    usability across different platforms and devices, ensuring a wider reach and inclusivity. I ensured
                    that my site is usable on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones through
                    flexbox and media queries in CSS to create a seamless experience across different screen sizes and
                    orientations. This directly contributes to a positive UX, it prevents usability issues such as
                    unreadable text, unclickable links, or distorted layouts, which can frustrate users and drive them
                    away. Since search engines like Google have adapted their algorithms to prioritize mobile-friendly
                    websites in their rankings. Responsive design is integral to SEO strategies as it helps in reducing
                    bounce rates and increasing time on site by providing a better user experience. Moreover,
                    maintaining a single responsive site rather than separate desktop and mobile versions simplifies URL
                    structure and eliminates duplicate content, both of which are beneficial for SEO.</p>
                <p>Considering that is a commercial website, from a business perspective, responsive design aligns with
                    professional practices by being cost-effective. Maintaining one website that adapts to all devices,
                    rather than separate sites for desktop and mobile, reduces development and maintenance costs. It
                    simplifies the web development process and decreases the likelihood of inconsistencies between
                    different versions of a site. As new devices with different screen sizes and resolutions come to
                    market, a responsive website can adapt to these without needing a complete redesign. This
                    future-proofing aspect makes responsive design a sustainable choice for long-term development.</p>
