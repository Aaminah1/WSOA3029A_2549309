                <p>There is significant room for improvement in my website project, particularly because some elements feel disjointed and incomplete. For instance, the footer’s layout and the stark contrast between the pure black background and pure white text are too harsh, which can be visually straining. Additionally, there are functional issues with the data visualizations. The tooltip on the map does not align with the cursor, often disappearing off-screen, which complicates usability. I also encountered unexpected complexities with the zoom and panning features; changes in the viewport coordinates during zooming disrupted the positioning of tooltips and affected the functionality of the bubble chart, leading to overlapping bubbles and obscured information.</p> <p>I removed the search functionality due to coding errors, which needs revisiting. Moreover, the responsiveness and bug issues in the data visualizations indicate that I need to enhance my technical skills, perform more thorough research, and manage my time more effectively. Despite these challenges, the project has solid foundations, featuring some dynamic effects and a successful implementation of my initial concepts.</p>      
     
                <p>Overall, I’m proud of the consistency and design choices throughout the project. The website maintains a minimalist aesthetic with a good balance of information, text, and images. The arrangement of elements feels intuitive, and the navigation is smooth, enhancing the user experience. I’m particularly happy with the iconic use of visuals, ensuring that nothing feels cluttered or overwhelming. The visual theme is well-reflected in the project, from the subtle animation of the buttons to the dynamic planets and stars that tie into the overall concept.</p> <p>However, there are areas that could be refined. I may have been too minimal in some places, such as avoiding subtitles or instructions in the data visualizations. While I hoped the design would be intuitive enough for users to figure out on their own, I’ve realized that additional guidance like zoom and pan buttons would improve accessibility. I also noticed that the legend symbols were too small and unstable, affecting their clarity. Moreover, the slight design differences between the legends of both visuals created inconsistency and might confuse users, reducing their familiarity with the interface.</p> <p>There are still technical issues to address, particularly with the bubble chart. Occasionally, the bubbles shrink unexpectedly, requiring the page to be refreshed to fix the layout. I will need to investigate this further. Despite these setbacks, I’m happy with the project’s creative direction and the thoughtful integration of my theme across different elements. The visual effects, such as the glowing and sparkling buttons, and the overall design reflect my concept well, and I’ve learned valuable lessons that I can apply to improve this further.</p>
