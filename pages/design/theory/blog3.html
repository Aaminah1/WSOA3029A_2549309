                <h2>Getting started </h2>
                <p>The first step and challenge were to figure out the appropriate folder structure to ensure that the
                    site is
                    organized well so that it makes the development process easier and efficient for maintenance and
                    scalability, as well as SEO and Performance. I also learned about the naming conventions to become
                    more
                    familiar with how to work and design in more professional contexts. </p>
                <p>I did some research on the best practices and considered them in relation to my design. Here is my
                    starting
                    folder structure: </p>
                <div class="centered-image-container">

                            alt="screenshot representing folder structure of site">

                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>

            <section>
                <h2>Why This Structure Works</h2>

                <h3>Keeps the Root Directory Clean</h3>
                <p>By only keeping essential files in the root (such as index.html), the root directory stays organized
                    and
                    easy to navigate. All other files are stored in relevant subfolders, avoiding clutter.</p>

                <h3>Logical Grouping</h3>
                <p>Storing CSS, JavaScript, and images within an /assets folder ensures that all non-HTML resources are
                    grouped together logically, making it easier to manage these files as the project scales.</p>

                <h3>Index Files for Folders and Clean URLs</h3>
                <p>Each section has its own folder with an index.html file. This not only keeps the structure organized
                    but
                    also allows for clean URLs (e.g., website.com/about/ instead of website.com/about.html).</p>

                <h4>Clean URLs Matter because:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>SEO Benefits:</strong>
                        <p>
                            Clean URLs, which are concise and free of unnecessary characters (like .html or query
                            strings),
                            are better for search engines. They improve rankings because they are easier for search
                            engine
                            crawlers to understand and index. For example, website.com/about/ clearly indicates the page
                            content, helping search engines better categorize and rank it.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Improved User Experience:</strong>
                        <p>
                            Clean URLs are more readable and user-friendly. They give users a clear indication of the
                            page’s
                            content and purpose without clutter or technical file extensions. This makes the website
                            feel
                            more professional and accessible, and users are more likely to trust and navigate a site
                            that is
                            simple and clear.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Scalability and Maintenance</h3>
                <p>This structure easily supports the addition of new sections or pages without major restructuring.</p>
